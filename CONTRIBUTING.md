Contributing to Node Unblocker
==============================

Contributing to node unblocker is fairly easy, there are only a couple of requirements.
 
Note: These requirements are only for code that you want merged into the main repo (https://github.com/nfriedly/node-unblocker). 
You're free to work on your own fork without following any of these requirements (you must still follow the terms of the AGPL, however).


Copyright Assignment
====================

* By sending a pull request or otherwise contributing code to the main repo, **you agree to assign all copyright of your contribution to Nathan Friedly**.

This is necessary for commercial licenses which support this project and it's contributors.


Tests and Style
===============

Please ensure all tests pass and please add tests for any significant feature or bugfix (and perhaps even the insignificant ones). 

For coding style, simply run `npm run beautify` and I'll be happy.
